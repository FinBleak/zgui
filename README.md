Yet another GUI framework written in **C++17**.
Its main goal is to **provide** simple but powerful API for creating user inferface. Also `zgui` **dependency free** and its really easy to use. **Code scalability** makes it highly extensible library. 
  
__NOTE__: 2.0 version is recode of the base `zgui`, if you want to use old version, you will find it on `legacy` branch.
